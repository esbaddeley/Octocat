A git branch create a new track or development pathway for a project that allows you to work on a specific task, like adding a new feature, whilst preserving the main project on the main branch. This allows for multiple developers to work building new features similtaneously, and ensures that unstable or buggy code is not committed to the main code base. Branches can be merged back into the main code base when development is complete, which incorporates the histories of both branches (without destroying anything. They can also be rebased, which rewrites the history of the master branch to include the developments of the new branch, this is more dangerous as it involves destroying the original history of the master branch.
